# Guide for regularjs

Regularjs is a __"string-based living template engine"__ aiming to helping you to create interactive component. it provide: 

1. __data-binding__ based on dirty-check
2. __string-based template__ 
3. __independent lifecycle__ —— can be integrated with whatever framework you already used.
4. __nested component__
5. class-based component. just like [angular-classy](http://davej.github.io/angular-classy/) do for angular
6. __directive, filter, event__ is supported, and extend easily.


### Why named regularjs

Regularjs provide data-binding that based on dirty-check,  which is similar with angular. meanwhile , it has the same philosophy with react: state-driven component. Finally, the definition of Component is similar with ractive that is also based on Class.

For these reasons, although regularjs is __not based on regular , react and ractive__. we also use the attractive slogan.

>### __regular = react(ractive) + angular__






## Naming Convention
* __Component__: Regular and Regular's SubClass
* __component(lowercase)__:  the Component's instance
