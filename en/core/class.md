#Class-based Component 

Regularjs's OO implementation is modified from famous [ded:klass](https://github.com/ded/klass) which have one brilliant feature that you can simply using `this.supr` to call the parent's method with same name.


There are only two interfaces of klass are remained at regularjs, `extend` and `implement`.only the methods defined by these two interfaces have the ability to call `this.supr()`.


> In regularjs, the Base Class of All Component is `Regular`, it is also a Component.



<a name="extend"></a>
### 1. `Component.extend(Object specification)`

`Component.extend` is used to define  SubComponent extended from Component，specification will merge to the SubComponent.prototype.


__The important part of sepecification__

-  __[AST|String] template__ : you can pass
  * a css selector point to the node contains template string

    if the browser doesnt support selector api. you can either rewirte the depended `Regular.dom.find` or only pass '#id' selector.
  * template string.
  * preparsed AST from template(via `Regular.parse()`)

- __[Function]   init()__: 
  
  initialize function. in this function, the dom structure is generated by `this.$compile`

  you can also bind the 'init' event.

  ```javascript
  this.$on('init', function(){...})
  ```


- [Function]   config(data): 
  
  config is called before init when dom structure is not generated already.
  


- [Function]   destroy: 

  custom cleaning logic goes here. make sure that you call the `this.supr()` to have the work done if you rewirte the `destroy()`.

  you can also bind the 'destroy' event to do the work.

  ```javascript
  this.$on('destroy', function(){...})
  ```

- [String]     name: 

  component name. it makes the component [be nestable](../advanced/component.md) in other component(e.g. `<pager current={{current}}/>`)



`Component.extend` will also do some preprocessing work.

1. preparse the passed template.
2. prototypal inherit the Parent's events, directives and fitlers[Learn More](../core/use.md)
3. if name is passed in. regular will register this Component.


[DEMO: modal](http://fiddle.jshell.net/leeluolee/Xvp9S/)

<a name="implement"></a>
### 2. `Component.implement(Object specification)`

Extend Component's prototype.

__Example__

```javascript
var Component = Regular.extend();


var component = new Component();

// add hello to prototype
Component.implement({
  hello: function(){}
})

component.hello();

```


<a name="instance"></a>

### 3.`new Component(Object specification)`

Initialize a Component.

Specification in initialize and `Component.extend` is almost the same. the only difference is ——  in `Component.extend` is a prototype-assignment , but in initalize it is a instance-assignment . so the initialize stage can override the specification passed in `Component.extend`. 

__Example__

```javascript
var modal = new Modal({
  data: {title: 'confirm', content: 'please confirm your email'} 
})

modal.$on('confirm', function(){
  console.log('confirm!!')
});
```

__The method defined in initalize can not call the `this.supr()`__
