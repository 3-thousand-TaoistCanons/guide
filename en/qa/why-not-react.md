# Why Not react.md

[Ractive](ractivejs.org) is also a awesome framework, it almost become my choice beacuse it's feature list: 

1. string-based template
2. data-binding support
3. transition support
4. ...

but ractive's data-binding based on setter/getter is not    . the mustache syntax combine with expression is a litte weird. ractive also dont have innate modular support
